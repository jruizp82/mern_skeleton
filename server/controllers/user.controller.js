/* This function creates a new user with the user JSON object that's received in the POST request from the frontend within req.body. The call to user.save attempts to save
the new user in the database after Mongoose has performed a validation check on the data. Consequently, an error or success response is returned to the requesting client.

The create function is defined as an asynchronous function with the async keyword, allowing us to use await with user.save(), which returns a Promise. 
Using the await keyword inside an async function causes this function to wait until the returned Promise resolves, before the next lines of code are executed. 
If the Promise rejects, an error is thrown and caught in the catch block.
