authentication method defined in UserSchema is used to verify the password that's received in req.body from the client.
If the password is successfully verified, the JWT module is used to generate a signed JWT using a secret key and the user's _id value.

Then, the signed JWT is returned to the authenticated client, along with the user's details. Optionally, we can also set the token to a cookie in the response object so that
it is available to the client-side if cookies are the chosen form of JWT storage. On the client-side, this token must be attached as an Authorization header when
requesting protected routes from the server. To sign-out a user, the client-side can simply delete this token depending on how it is being stored.
