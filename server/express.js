/* Currently, when the React Router routes or pathnames are directly entered in the browser address bar or when a view that is not at the root path is refreshed, the URL does not work. 
This happens because the server does not recognize the React Router routes we defined in the frontend. We have to implement basic server-side rendering on the backend 
so that the server is able to respond when it receives a request to a frontend route.

The basic idea behind server-side rendering React apps is to use the renderToString method from react-dom to convert the root React component into a markup string. 
Then, we can attach it to the template that the server renders when it receives a request.

In express.js, we will replace the code that returns template.js in response to the GET request for '/' with code that, upon receiving any incoming GET request, 
generates some server-side rendered markup and the CSS of the relevant React component tree, before adding this markup and CSS to the template.
*/

/* To generate the CSS and markup representing the React frontend views on the serverside, we will use Material-UI's ServerStyleSheets and React's renderToString.
On every request received by the Express app, we will create a new ServerStyleSheets instance. Then, we will render the relevant React tree with the server-side collector 
in a call to renderToString, which ultimately returns the associated markup or HTML string version of the React view that is to be shown to the user in response to the requested URL.

    needed by the MainRouter child components. The stateless StaticRouter is used here instead of the BrowserRouter that's used on the client-side in order to wrap
    MainRouter and provide the routing props that are used for implementing the clientside components.

    Based on these values, such as the requested location route and theme that are passed in as props to the wrapping components, renderToString will return the
    markup containing the relevant view.

    An example of a case where redirect is rendered in the component is when we're trying to access a PrivateRoute via a server-side render. As the server-side cannot 
    access the auth token from the browser's sessionStorage, the redirect in PrivateRoute will render. The context.url value , in this case, will have the '/signin' route, 
    and hence, instead of trying to render the PrivateRoute component, it will redirect to the '/signin' route.
